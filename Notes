DAY 1
---------------
Protocol Data Unit (PDU)
  Session-Application -> Data
  Transport -> Segment/Datagram
  Network -> Packet
  Data Link -> Frame
  Physical -> Bit

Internet Standards (Organizations)
  IETF = RFC
  IANA - Internet Numbers
    # The ones that control who owns a set of IP's
  IEEE - LAN/WAN electrical standards
    # Responsible for maintaining standards for protocols


Layer 1 (Physical)
  # There are bits at this level
  # binary, decimal, hex, base64
  word = 32 bits
  half word = 16 bits
  byte = 8
  nibbles = 4
Topologies
> Bus
  # Half-Duplex
  # Straight line
> Star
  # Switch is at the center of the star
> Ring
  # Key that is shared with the devices in the ring
> Mesh
  # Some are connected to each other, or all are connected to each other
> Wireless
  # Wireless devices are connected to a modem
> Hierarchial 
  # More aligned with an enterprise level company topology
  # Firewalls, Different layers
Devices
> Hubs
  # Everyone gets everything (Doesnt check frames that are sent)
  # it broadcasts to all ports (Packet Collision)
> Repeaters
  # Like hub, but amplifies signal so its stronger
> Switches
> Routers
  # Based off of IP
Ethernet Timing (Bit-Time) ???????? <- Research Later
Speed        Bit-Time
10Mbps       100ns
100Mbps      10ns
1 Gps        1ns
10 Gbps     .1ns
100 Gbps    .01ns

Layer 2 (Data-Link)
MAC (Medium Access Control)
  # Transpose Layer 2 - 3 (Goes UP the OSI Model)
LLC (Logical Link Control
  # Transpose to MAC Address (Goes DOWN the OSI Model)

Switch Operation
  # build MAC Address (CAM) Table
    > Learns by reading source MAC Addresses
  # Forwarding Frames
    > Decision based on destination MAC Address

> Switching Modes
  > Cut through
    # Default Method
  > Fragment-Free
    # Stores first 64 bytes of the frame (Ethernet portion) before forwarding
  > Store-and-Forward
    # Information is kept and sent at a later time to the destination
