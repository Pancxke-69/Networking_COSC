[Tunnel Practice]

/> ssh user@localhost -p 1234 -L 11201:172.17.17.28(tB):23
  > # Establish a tunnel that allows lin-ops to telnet to target B through a specified tunnel port
Telnet in:
/> telnet 172.17.17.28 11201
  > # Telnet through port made from the tunnel that established telnet
/> ssh user@172.17.17.17 -p 1234 -R 11211:localhost:4321
  > # Establish reverse tunnel from target B back to target A
/> lin-ops:
/> ssh user@localhost -p 1234 11203:localhost:11211
  > # Join local and reverse tunnels together by taking the port from the local tunnel, and the port from the reverse tunnel and joining them together with a new port
/> ssh user@localhost -p 11203 -D 9050
  >  # Establish a dynamic tunnel using the port that joined the two tunnels together so we can run proxychains for target B

    > In-Line
      > # Test Access Point (TAP)
        > # Appliance placed between 2 network devices
        > # Must be placed "in line" of network traffic
        > # Not scalable
      > # Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
        > # Attacker can use ARP or some other method/protocol

    > Out of band (Passive)
      > # Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN)
        > # Allows us to take multiple ports and put it down in one port
        > # Can have a high degree of packet loss

Fingerprinting and Host Identification
> Fingerprinting
  > # Easier
  > # Send packets to the target and monitor response
  > Tools:
    > # Nmap
    > # Xprobe2
    > # sinfp3
  > Passive OS fingerprinting
    > # More difficult
    > # Rely on sniffing packets
    > Tools:
      > # p0f
        > # Looks at variations in:
          > # Initial TTL
          > # Fragmentation Flag
          > # Default IP Header packet length
          > # Windows size
          > # TCP Options
        > # Config stored in /etc/p0f/p0f.fp
      > # Ettercap
      > # PRADS

Anomoly Detection
> Indicator of Attack (IOA)
  > # Proactive
  > # A series of actions that are suspicious together
  > # Focus on Intent
  > # Looks for what must happen
    > # Code execution, persistence, lateral movement, etc.
> Indicator of Compromise (IOC)
  > # Reactive
  > # Forensic Evidence
  > # Provides information that can change
    > # Malware, IP addresses, exploits, signatures
> Some Indicators
  > # .exe/executable files
  > # NOP sled
  > # Repeated Letters
  > # Well known signatures
  > # Mismatched Protocols
  > # Unusual traffic
  > # Large amounts of traffic/ unusual times
> Signs of IOA
  > # Destination IP/PORTS
  > # Public Servers/DMZs
  > # Off-Hours
  > # Network Scans
  > # Alarm Events
  > # Malware Reinfection
  > # Remote Logins
  > # High amounts of some protocols
> Signs of IOC
  > # Unusual traffic outbound
  > # Anomalous user login or account use
  > # Size of responses for HTML
  > # High number of requests for the same files
  > # Using non-standard ports/ applicatino-port mismatch
  > # Writing changes to the registry/system files
  > # Unexpected/unusual patching or tasks

Viewing Network Anomalies through traffic analysis
> ICMP Tunneling
  > # ICMP PING uses type 8 and type 0
  > # Both should be
    > # 1 for 1
    > # Same size and payload
  > Look out for:
    > # Request/Reply imbalances
    > # Abnormal/different payloads
> DNS Tunneling
  > # DNS Uses Query/Response
    > # 1 Query typically gets 1 response
  > Look out for:
    > # Query/Response imbalances
    > # Abnormal/different payloads
    > # Continuous Queries
> HTTP(S) Tunneling
  > # HTTP is "bursty" in nature
  > # Client issues request and the server responds
  > Look out for:
    > # Steady connections
    > # HTTPs you will need to check session establishment for abnormalities
> Beaconing
  > # Call back to the C&C server (Command and Control)
  > # Gets/sends commands from/to C&C
  > Look out for:
    > # Beacon timing
      > # Commonly at regular intervals
    > # Beacon size
      > # Check-Ins may not have any payloads
      > # Orders will have payloads
