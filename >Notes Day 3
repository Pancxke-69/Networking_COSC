Socket Types
> Stream Sockets (TCP)    <- (User) Space Sockets
> Datagram Sockets (UDP)    <- (User) Space Sockets
> Raw Sockets (Configure)    <- (Kernel) Space Sockets
  > # Tells hardware to just send it out because we are going to be configuring it. Thats why it requires SUDO


User Space
> # NMAP no switches
> # TCPDUMP or wireshark to read a file
> # Using netcat to connect to a listener (Dont use SUDO to banner grab)
> # Using netcat to create a listener above the well known port range (1024+)
Kernel Space
> # Capturing packets on the wire
> # OS Identification or to set specific flags when scanning
> # Using scapy to craft or modify a packet for transmission
> # Using python to craft or modify RAW sockets for transmission
> # Network devices using routing protocols such as OSPF
> # Any traffic without Transport Header (ICMP)


Python
> import {module}
> from {module} import *
  > # allows to call functions from module like the function was literally inside your code so instead of example.funct() it would just be funct()
> socket.socket [ SYNTAX: socket.socket( <family>, <type>, <proto> ) ] (import socket)
